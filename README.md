# bitcoin-price-checker-gpt4
Bitcoin-price-checker is a simple plugin that I created for Chrome using GPT-4. It allows users to monitor the current Bitcoin price and receive price alerts. The plugin also displays the price evolution over the last 24 hours.


## To run the plugin in developer mode in Chrome, follow these steps:

- Open Chrome and type "chrome://extensions/" in the address bar.
- Turn on the "Developer mode" toggle switch in the top right corner of the screen.
- Click on the "Load unpacked" button in the top left corner of the screen.
- Browse to the location where you have saved the plugin files and select the folder containing the files.
- Once the folder is selected, the plugin should appear in the list of installed extensions in developer mode.

Now you can test and modify the plugin code as needed. Remember to reload the plugin after making any changes for them to take effect.
